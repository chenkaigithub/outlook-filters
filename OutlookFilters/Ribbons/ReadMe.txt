Ribbon vs RibbonUI
------------------

This is a ribbon with a backstage component and the current way to implement a
backstage is to do so by hand.  Please see [1] for more information.

I'm rather fond of using the visual designer so 'RibbonUI' has not been deleted
and is around purely for visual design editing; the actual ribbon logic resides
in 'Ribbon'.
